Reffer to version chart for reffernce:
  - https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu
  - In our case following versions are used:
    - python: 3.10.12
      - python --version
    - tensorflow: 2.15.0
      - python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
    - CUDA: 12.2
      - nvcc --version
    - cuDNN: 8.9
      - 

Setup env and install requirements:
  - Note:
    - These steps are for Linus based system
    - For Windows tenforflow 2.10 was the last version to support GPU. Post that you need to install tensorflow in WSL  
    - In case GPU are not abailable, CPU will be used. Although it will be 3 times slower
  - conda create -n wsl_tf_p31012 python=3.10.12
  - Common libs: conda install numpy pandas seaborn xgboost matplotlib tqdm pillow
  - Tensorflow: python -m pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]
    - This will install tensorflow supporting parallel computing onGPU using CUDA
  - Check GPU visibility: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
  - Also add cuda to PATH: export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin/:$PATH
  - Test if CUDN is correctly installed: nvcc -V


Install CUDA for parallel computing on GPU:
  - Go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive and choose apt version
  - In our case it will take us to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-2-2-download-archive as we want to install 12.2.x
    - Choose apt Arch and ditro (and version)
    - Choose network for installation
    - Follow the instructions provided after that you will install cudnn-cuda-12
    - In My case following commands were executed:
      - wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.2.2/local_installers/cuda_12.2.2_535.104.05_linux.run
      - sudo sh cuda_12.2.2_535.104.05_linux.run


Install CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN) for Deep learning neaural network computing:
  - Go to https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive and choose apt version (might need login)
  - In our case we chose 8.9.7 version
  - Download the deb file and install using
    - sudo dpkg -i <absolute path>
  - Test if cuDNN is correctly installed:
    - sudo apt-get install libcudnn9-samples
    - cd /usr/src/cudnn_samples_v9/mnistCUDNN
    - sudo make clean
    - sudo make
      - If case you see and error like this: 'test.c:1:10: fatal error: FreeImage.h: No such file or directory'
        - Run: sudo apt-get install libfreeimage3 libfreeimage-dev
    - ./mnistCUDNN
      - It will output 'Test Passed!' in the end, which means cudnn is installed correctly
